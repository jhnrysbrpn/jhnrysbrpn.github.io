      it makes me want to be with you all the time, we may not talk <br>
      that much but you are still often in my mind, I hope that we do<br>
      feel the same, and these feelings will never disappear from our hearts <br>
      along with the memories that we've made and will share together <br>
      with you by my side I do feel like the luckiest man alive! <br> 
      today is a beautiful day, I may not have a flower in my hand <br>
      but I have you in my heart, I'd like to share you my time to <br>
      have fun and enjoy the rest of the day
